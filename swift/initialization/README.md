# [Initialization](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/initialization)

*Initialization* is the process of preparing an instance of a class, structure or enumeration for use. This involves setting initial values for each stored property of that instance as well as any other setup that's required before the new instance is ready for use.

<br/>

## Setting Initial Values for Stored Properties

Classes and structures *must* set all of their stored properties to an appropriate initial value by the time an instance of that class or structure is created. This can be done either by assigning a default value as part of the property's definition or by setting an initial value within an initializer.

```swift
// Assigning a default value
class Farenheit {
    var temperature: Double = 32.0
}

// Setting initial value within initializer
class Farenheit {
    var temperature: Double

    init() {
        temperature = 32.0
    }
}
```
If a property always takes the same initial value, it is preferred to provide a default value rather than setting a value within an initializer.


> Note: When you assign a default value to a stored property, or set its initial value within an initializer, the value of that property is set directly, without calling any property observers.

<br/>

## Customizing Initialization

You can customize the initialization process by providing intialization parameters and/or defining multiple `init` methods with different signatures.

```swift
struct Celsius {
    var temperatureInCelsius: Double

    init(_ celsius: Double) {
        temperatureInCelsius = celsius
    }

    init(fromFahrenheit fahrenheit: Double) {
        temperatureInCelsius = (fahrenheit - 32.0) / 1.8
    }

    init(fromKelvin kelvin: Double) {
        temperatureInCelsius = kelvin - 273.15
    }
}

let bodyTemperature = Celsius(37.0)
print(bodyTemperature.temperatureInCelsius) // 37.0

let boilingPointOfWater = Celsius(fromFahrenheit: 212.0)
print(boilingPointOfWater.temperatureInCelsius) // 100.0

let freezingPointOfWater = Celsius(fromKelvin: 273.15)
print(freezingPointOfWater.temperatureInCelsius) // 0.0
```
<br/>

### Optional Property Types

If your class has a stored property of type `Optional`, it will automatically be initialized with a value of `nil`, so you don't need to explicitly set it during initialization.

```swift
class Dog {
    var name: String
    var toy: String?

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
        // No need to set toy because it is an optional
    }
}
```
<br/>

### Assigning Constant Properties During Initialization

You can assign a value to a constant property at any point during initialization, as long as it's set to a definite value by the time initialization finishes. Once a constant property is assigned a value, it can't be further modified.

```swift
class Person {
    let name: String

    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var person = Person(name: "Bob")
person.name = "Robert" // Error: Cannot assign to property: 'name' is a let constant
```

<br/>

## Default Initializers

If a structure or class provides default values for all of its stored properties and doesn't provide at least one initializer itself, Swift will create a *default initializer* which simply creates a new instance with all of its properties set to their default values.

```swift
class ShoppingListItem {
    var name: String?
    var quantity = 1
    var purchased = false
}
var item = ShoppingListItem()
```

Structures additionally receive a *memberwise initializer* (if they don't define any of their own custom initializers). If the above class were converted to a struct, we could initialize it with a memberwise initializer:

```swift
struct ShoppingListItem {
    var name: String?
    var quantity = 1
    var purchased = false
}
var item = ShoppingListItem()
var anotherItem = ShoppingListItem(name: "Carrot", quantity: 3, purchased: true)
```

When you call a memberwise initializer, you can omit values for any properties that have default values:

```swift
var bread = ShoppingListItem(name: "Bread", purchased: true)
var juice = ShoppingListItem(name: "Juice", quantity: 2)
var unknown = ShoppingListItem(quantity: 4)
```
> Note: When you omit properties in a memberwise initializer, the remaining properties still need to be provided in order

<br/>

## Initializer Delegation for Value Types

Initializers can call other initializers to perform part of an instanceâ€™s initialization. This process, known as *initializer delegation*, avoids duplicating code across multiple initializers.

In the following example, the third initializer `init(center:size:)`, calculates an appropriate origin and then calls (or delegates) to the `init(origin:size:)` initializer.

```swift
struct Size {
    var width = 0.0, height = 0.0
}

struct Point {
    var x = 0.0, y = 0.0
}

struct Rect {
    var origin = Point()
    var size = Size()

    init() {}

    init(origin: Point, size: Size) {
        self.origin = origin
        self.size = size
    }

    init(center: Point, size: Size) {
        let originX = center.x - (size.width / 2)
        let originY = center.y - (size.height / 2)
        self.init(origin: Point(x: originX, y: originY), size: size)
    }
}
```

Deinitializers perform any custom cleanup just before an instance of that class is deallocated.
