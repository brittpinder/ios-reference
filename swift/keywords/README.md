# Keywords

### [`didSet`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Property-Observers)

* A *property observer* that gets called right after a property is set
* Referenced in [Properties](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/properties#property-observers)

### [`final`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/inheritance#Preventing-Overrides)

* Prevents a class, method, property or subscript from being overriden
* Referenced in [Inheritance](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/inheritance#final)

### [`get`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Computed-Properties)

* Defines the "getter" of a computed property
* Referenced in [Properties](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/properties#computed-properties)

### [`guard`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow/#Early-Exit)

* Executes statements depending on the Boolean value of an expression. If the expression is true, the code after the guard statement is executed, otherwise the code within the `else` statement is executed.
* The accompanying `else` statement is mandatory and must transfer control to exit the code block in which the guard statement appears (using `return`, `break`, `continue`, `throw`, `fatalError` etc.)
* Referenced in [Optionals](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/optionals#optional-binding)

### [`lazy`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Lazy-Stored-Properties)

* Indicates that a stored property's initial value isn't calculated until the first time it's used
* Referenced in [Properties](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/properties#lazy-stored-properties)


### [`override`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/inheritance#Overriding)

* Overrides a method, property or subscript from the superclass
* Referenced in [Inheritance](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/inheritance)

### [`set`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Computed-Properties)

* Defines the "setter" of a computed property
* Referenced in [Properties](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/properties#setting-computed-properties)

### [`throw`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/errorhandling/#Representing-and-Throwing-Errors)

* Used to throw an error
* Referenced in [Error Handling and Assertions](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/error-handling#representing-and-throwing-errors)

### [`throws`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/errorhandling/#Propagating-Errors-Using-Throwing-Functions)

* Indicates that a function can throw
* Referenced in [Error Handling and Assertions](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/error-handling#propogating-errors-using-throwing-functions)

### [`try`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/errorhandling/#Handling-Errors)

* Used before a piece of code that calls a function, method or initializer that can throw an error
* The alternative `try?` converts the result of the throwing expression to an optional
* The alternative `try!` disables error propogation by wrapping the call in a runtime assertion that no error will be thrown
* Referenced in [Error Handling and Assertions](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/error-handling#handling-errors-using-do-catch)

### [`willSet`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/properties/#Property-Observers)

* A *property observer* that gets called right before a property is set
* Referenced in [Properties](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/properties#property-observers)
