### [`guard`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/controlflow/#Early-Exit)

* Executes statements depending on the Boolean value of an expression. If the expression is true, the code after the guard statement is executed, otherwise the code within the `else` statement is executed.
* The accompanying `else` statement is mandatory and must transfer control to exit the code block in which the guard statement appears (using `return`, `break`, `continue`, `throw`, `fatalError` etc.)
* Referenced in [Optionals](https://github.com/brittpinder/ios-reference/tree/main/swift/optionals#optional-binding)


### [`override`](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/inheritance#Overriding)
